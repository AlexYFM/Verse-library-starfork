# Adaptation of F16 model 

This is an adaptation of the Python F16 model from [Stanley Bak](https://github.com/stanleybak/AeroBenchVVPython). 
All the files are copied to make this example a standalone executable. Requires you to add ```/Users/mitras/Dpp/GraphGeneration/demo/F16``` to PYTHONPATH. 

Test by ```python3  F16_waypoint_scene.py```
